    <h2>What our customers say?</h2>
    <p>“The service is so friendly and the matcha bingsoo I had was amazing. Definitely will come back!” <img src="img/o.jpg" alt="customer's bingsoo photo"</p>
    <p>I took the matcha bingsoo and it tasted amazing! I did not have high expectations for some reason, but after eating there, I would go back. It is a bit pricey, but we don't have a lot of those in Montreal.</p>
    <p>Loved the shaved ice (bingso) here!! I'm from Toronto it's been hard to find these Asian type of shaved ice! The coffee here were delicious too! Going to come back and try some of their cake!</p>
    <p>First time trying bingsoo. Order at the counter and took the large mango bingsoo. The shaved ice was very fine and a lot of syrup on top in the middle and sweetened milk? In the bottom. Very nice people and environment. Definitely returning for the other items on the menu!</p>
